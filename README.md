# PHP-Admin-Tools
PHP shell to upload to....someone!?

A couple php admin scripts to upload to web if needed, uses ajax to open a new window and inject the info into it...still displays the servers info (phpinfo) in the popup, pretty cool! also a terminal within the code, and other fun stuff to upload to that unsuspecting server you forgot your password too.

⚠️WARNING⚠️ 
THIS CODE IS TO BE USED FOR GOOD STUFF ONLY, LIKE HELPING FRIENDS OR COWORKERS. UPLOADING THIS TO YOUR FRIENDS JOBSITE AT THE (netjets building...lol) TO FUCK WITH THEM IS NOT ADVISED!!! (tell me i cant run commands...pfffft) Drink responsibly and always have someone drinking with you at all times, especially someone who can share the cost of an uber or lyft because of inflation.
