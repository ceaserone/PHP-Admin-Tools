PHP shell to upload to....someone!?

A couple php admin scripts to upload to web if needed, uses ajax to open a new window and still display the aervers phpinfo in the popup injecting the code into the pooup, pretty cool! also a terminal within the code, and other fun stuff to upload to that unsuspecting server you forgot to dave access too.
